<br/>

- I switched focus from Product Management to DevOps Engineering full time. I would really love to grow and help others interested in become a Cloud Architect or DevOps Engineer especially in Africa. Building communities that thrive and increase open-source collaborations and creating technology to elevate people
- I'm a business-oriented technologist with few years of experience helping startup to dive into technology
- Working to build experience in VMs, Containers, Kubernetes, Security & Structured Pipelines
- My main goal is to improve my professional skills while recreating & redesigning projects in a wide range of technologies.
- I hope to take up challenging position where I can effectively contribute my technical skills and help me grow as an individual and acutely gain business knowledge.
- I love community development as I am a pioneer in many of the communities in Libeira including:
  * [GDG Monrovia](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-monrovia)
  * [WordPress Monrovia](https://www.meetup.com/monrovia-wordpress-meetup/)
  * Python Liberia
